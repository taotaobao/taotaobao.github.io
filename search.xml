    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Welcome to TaoTaoBaoâ€™s Blog Every blog starts with &apos;Hello World!&apos;, so do mine. I am TaoTaoBao, the maker of this Blog. My Blog contains my occational thoughts and records some tiny parts of my life (happiness and sorrow). Also, TaoTaoBao&apos;s Blog is the place where I write articles about CFA learning and Fintech. I&apos;d like to study finance and economics in both fundamental and technical methods. I paln to include the prospectus study, which is, I think, the best way to understand the industry. Last but not least, I will blog my English learning details, which I hope can motivate me to learn English better.]]></content>
